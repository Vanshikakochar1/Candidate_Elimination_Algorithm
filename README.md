# Candidate_Elimination_Algorithm
Candidate Elimination Learning Algorithm is a method for learning concepts from data that is supervised.


Given a hypothesis space H and a collection E of instances, the candidate elimination procedure develops the version space progressively. 


***Terms Used:***

•	Concept learning: Concept learning is basically learning task of the machine (Learn by Train data)

•	General Hypothesis: Not Specifying features to learn the machine.

•	G = {‘?’, ‘?’,’?’,’?’…}: Number of attributes

•	Specific Hypothesis: Specifying features to learn machine (Specific feature)

•	S= {‘pi’,’pi’,’pi’…}: Number of pi depends on number of attributes.

•	Version Space: It is intermediate of general hypothesis and Specific hypothesis. It not only just written one hypothesis but a set of all possible hypothesis based on training data-set.
